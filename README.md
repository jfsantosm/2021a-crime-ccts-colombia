## The Effect of Conditional Cash Transfer Policies on Crime: Evidence from a Synthetic Controls Framework

In the academic literature, there is not a broad agreement on the relationship between
violent crime and the expansion of conditional cash transfer programs. This chapter sheds
some light onto the impact that the largest of these type of programs has on homicide
rates in Colombian municipalities. The causality link is exposed using synthetic control
methods. This study is focalised in one of the most violent regions in the country, the
Pacific region. The results suggest that when accounting for variance instability, the
homicide rates in treated regions are lower than their synthetic control counterparts. Also,
placebo studies are performed to evaluate the significance of the results. On average,
the effects of the conditional cash transfer program on homicide rates are reported to be
significant at a 5% level. The chapter concludes with a discussion of future research that
can be conducted on the impact of social welfare on other types of crimes, and another
robustness checks that can be performed to test the findings of this chapter.
